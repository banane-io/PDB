What We Need
===
We currently need someone to tutor us in the best practices for Rails. We are both new to the framework and the language, so our code still isn't clean enough. We do not have good tests and we're still in the learning curve.

We will need help with the layout and the aesthetics of the site. We're both programmers so our forte is not design. Feel free to suggest some improvements design wise.
